Over 9 tests, each Theory only passed once with Theory 1 being the most
consistent and seemingly most efficent, whereas the random method was dead
last being the least efficent and least consistent with theory 2 being 
right in the middle.

It seemed very rare to get below 20 guesses with the only instances of this
happening in where the case is solved.

Theory 1: It seems to be the most efficent and consistent across the board,
even if it has the same sucecss rating as the other two theories, this
appears to be going about solving the case in the best way.

Theory 2: Most likely a brute force approach, not super efficent but certainly better than a random search

Theory 3: Worst approach, awful efficency and consistency, somehow got the job done once but did so in a manner that was less efficent that Theories 1 and 2.
